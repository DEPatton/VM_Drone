  Hello to all who stumble upon this repository! This project revolves around an Android application designed to interface with a physical drone. 
The application offers multiple control methods: users can manipulate the drone via an in-app remote controller, utilize voice commands transmitted through the microphone to communicate with the drone, or employ a visual model for intuitive drone manipulation.
I am utilizing Thonny to write Python code specifically for a Raspberry Pi Pico, which serves as the interface for sending and receiving commands that will be integrated with the application. 
Apart from these functionalities, an additional feature will be implemented to leverage GPS, enabling the precise determination of the drone's location. 

To install Thonny, visit https://thonny.org. From there, you can download the application for Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems.

To install Android Studio, follow this link: https://developer.android.com/studio.

As for getting started with Android Studio on a Windows-based system, after installing the software, I recommend clicking on "New Project" to begin with a clean slate. Currently, the project is in its alpha stage.
